## Hi there and welcome to my repository 👋 📂 ✨

My name is **Rael**, nice to meet you!  
I recently completed the **CS50 course from Harvard**, which has ignited my passion for computer science and where I developed strong foundation in technical and analytical skills.

Now, I am pursuing a technology degree in Systems Analysis and Development at FATEC Rubens Lara.
